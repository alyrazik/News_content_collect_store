              "   \"Police have not suggested a motive for the attack in Nice. However, it follows days of protests in some Muslim-majority countries triggered by President Macron's defence of French cartoons that depict the Prophet Mohammed. There have been calls in some countries for a boycott of French goods.\",\n",

Things were bad enough then - and many more people died in those attacks. So why does this outbreak of Islamist violence feel somehow more scary? ',\n",
              "   'One reason must be the symbolism of the Samuel Paty beheading. That a simple history teacher could be murdered - and not randomly but actually selected for murder - has been deeply unsettling for French people. Likewise the targeting today of Christian worshippers in Nice.',\n",

The Afghan intelligence services announced on Saturday they had killed Husam Abd al-Rauf, a high ranking Egyptian al-Qaeda member, in an operation in Ghazni province. Mr Fitton-Brown told the BBC that despite its lower profile, al-Qaeda remained \"resilient\" and \"dangerous\".',\n",

The Taliban's commitments on international terrorism are the most tangible demands that need to be met as part of the US-Taliban withdrawal agreement.

              "   '\"Xi Jinping wants Taiwan back,\" says Professor Steve Tsang, director of the China Institute at London\\'s School of Oriental and African Studies. \"And Xi Jinping wants to have Taiwan back before he hands over power to whoever comes next.\" ',\n",

              "   '\"Suddenly everything he said about Taiwan took on a whole different meaning,\" she says. \"The timeline of when he said he wanted this issue resolved is now tied to his legitimacy as leader and his tenure as a leader.\" ',\n",
              "   \"Prof Tsang says Xi Jinping views himself as a great historical figure, with a mission to complete what China's previous paramount leaders, including Mao himself, could not. \",\n",
              "   '\"Deng Xiaoping could not get Taiwan,\" he explains. \"Even Chairman Mao couldn\\'t get Taiwan. And if Xi Jinping gets Taiwan, (he) is greater not only than Deng Xiaoping, but Mao Zedong.\"',\n",
              "   'Xi Jinping has stated publicly that Taiwan reunification is an \"inevitable requirement for the great rejuvenation of the Chinese people\". The timetable for completion of his \"great rejuvenation\" project is 2049, the 100th anniversary of the communist revolution. That is nearly 30 years away. ',\n",
              "   'But there is reason to think Xi is in more of a hurry.  ',\n",
              "   'The first is that China may soon have the military capability to defeat the United States in a war over Taiwan. ',\n",
              "   '\"For the past 20 years, the main question that most people ask is, will the United States defend its allies and partners?\" says Ms Mastro. \"It was a question of resolve. Will the United States come to Taiwan\\'s aid? But as the Chinese military becomes more advanced, the question has shifted from will they, to can they?\"',\n",

              "   '\"What happened at Scarborough Shoal from April to June 2012 is America\\'s biggest foreign policy failure in Asia since our helicopters took off from the roofs of those embassy buildings in Saigon in 1975,\" he says, referring to the US military defeat in the Vietnam War.',\n",

Control of the island would give Beijing what General Douglas MacArthur once called an \"unsinkable aircraft carrier in the Pacific\". Ms Mastro says a Chinese victory over Taiwan would completely re-draw the strategic map of Asia. ',\n",
              "   '\"If China does fight a war over Taiwan and wins, not only do they get to reunify with Taiwan, but that\\'s basically the end of the role of the United States as a leader in Asia as we know it,\" she explains. \"So, there are many benefits, actually, from the Chinese perspective.\"',\n",
              "   'In Washington there is now bipartisan recognition that the threat to Taiwan is growing. In a clear signal to China, the Trump administration has approved billions in arms sales to Taiwan, including, for the first time, advanced air-to-ground missiles. ',\n",
              "   'But it is still far from clear what the United States would do if Taiwan were attacked. Capt Fanell says that is a mistake. ',\n",
              "   '\"We know from history, we know the lack of support to the Kuwaiti government indicated to Saddam that he had a free rein to go into Kuwait,\" he explains. \"We know from the Korean War, statements that were equivocal gave China and Russia this idea that it was OK to attack in the Korean peninsula. If we don\\'t make some definitive statements about who our friends and allies are and what lengths we\\'ll go to defend them, then we leave them at risk.\" ',\n",
              "   'But Prof Tsang says there is also a lesson for Xi Jinping from those past conflicts. Belatedly, America did come to the aid of the Republic of Korea, and Kuwait. He says China would do well not to underestimate US military resolve once provoked. ',\n",
              "   '\"The spirit of the United States military is one that will fight and fight and fight,\" he explains. \"If the Chinese take that into account, I think they may be a bit more cautious in their calculations and the risk of miscalculation may be reduced.\" ',\n",
